  I trained my model in CelebA dataset and analysed the result. By applying the same features and
different noise to generator, I got various human faces with high quality. By applying the same noise and changing
one dimention of the features gradually, I studied how the generator learns about different features. As a result, the generator
can learn more about obvious feature such as Pale_Skin and Smiling. When things come to abstract features such as
Young and Attrctive,the generator does not work well. Also,for features with little sample in the dataset such as Eyeglasses
and Earrings,it is a disaster to force the generator to learn about them. As a result, this model can generate high qulity
human face images with rich diversity. However, some complex features or rare features are hard to learn by this model.

* Experiment1
These are some examples of experiment1:

[[file:img/attr1.jpg]]

labels: Brown_Hair,Pointy_Nose,Straight_Hair,Wearing_Earrings,Smiling,Attractive,No_Beard,Young,
Mouth_Slightly_Open,Heavy_Makeup,High_Cheekbones,Arched_Eyebrows,Wearing_Lipstick.

labels:High_Cheekbones,Attractive,Young,Male,Bushy_Eyebrows,Smiling,Black_Hair,
Oval_Face,No_Beard,Mouth_Slightly_Open,Bags_Under_Eyes,Straight_Hair.

As we can see, my model can generate high quality human face images and they can match
most of the labels.The diversity of the generated faces is also good. We can find
different faces even though the input labels are the same.

However, there are still some strange faces and some of the labels are not learned very well.
For example, the label Wearing_Earrings is not well treated.

* Experiment2
In this experiment,I apply the same noise and labels but change one of the labels gradually.
Let us see the difference:

Smiling

[[file:img/Pale_Skin.jpg]]


Pale_Skin

[[file:img/Bangs.jpg]]

Bangs

[[file:img/Big_Lips.jpg]]

Big_Lips

[[file:img/Black_Hair.jpg]]

Black_Hair

As we can see, the generator can learn simple features very well:)

[[file:img/Attractive.jpg]]

Attractive

I'm not sure whether she is getting more and more attractive:(
Those abstract features are more complex and difficult to learn.

[[file:img/Eyeglasses.jpg]]

Eyeglasses

The generator seems to think eyeglasses are black circles around the eyes:(
  I think the reason is samples with this label are too rare in celeba dataset.
