* ACGAN with labels
[[file:img/acgan.jpg]]

CGAN is widely used as an attribute driven GANs architechture.However,
the constrains to the generator is too strong that the discriminator
can get high accuracy by learning just one or two features.With the
number of features grows,the CGAN architechture will become more and
more slow.So I choosed ACGAN to deal with attribute-driven image generation problem.
* Generator
[[file:img/generator.jpg]]
| Layer    | Kernel Size | Strides | BN? | Dropout | Padding | Activation |
| Conv2D_1 |           3 | (1,1)   | yes | no      | same    | ReLU       |
| Conv2D_2 |           3 | (1,1)   | yes | no      | same    | ReLU       |
| Conv2D_3 |           3 | (1,1)   | yes | no      | same    | ReLU       |
| COnv2D-4 |           3 | (1,1)   | yes | no      | same    | ranh       |

I choose upsampling + convolution as deconvolution method to avoid

* Discriminator
[[file:img/discriminator.jpg]]
| Layer    | Kernel Size | Strides | BN? | Dropout | Padding | Activation |
| Conv2D_1 |           3 | (2,2)   | no  |    0.25 | same    | LeakyReLU  |
| Conv2D_2 |           3 | (1,1)   | yes |    0.25 | same    | LeakyReLU  |
| Conv2D_3 |           3 | (2,2)   | yes |    0.25 | same    | LeakyReLU  |
| Conv2D_4 |           3 | (1,1)   | yes |    0.25 | same    | LeakyReLU  |
| Conv2D_5 |           3 | (2,2)   | yes |    0.25 | same    | LeakyReLU  |
| Conv2D_6 |           3 | (1,1)   | yes |    0.25 | same    | LeakyReLU  |
* Training
The training is similar with ACGAN's training.I use the interpolation trick
in CGAN's training: To get a random feature in feature's distribution,
choose 2 random feature in the dataset and do an interpolation between
them.This method can get more feature from feature's distribution and
we don't need to train another generator on the features.
